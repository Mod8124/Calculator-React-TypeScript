## Overview
The app is a classical calculator with theme switch

## screen 
![theme](./design/desktop-design-theme-1.jpg)
![theme2](./design/desktop-design-theme-2.jpg)
![theme3](./design/desktop-design-theme-3.jpg)

## Features

 Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

Code :
- Standardize or giving style the code `eslint.json
- Use `Module pattern` and `Revelation Module pattern`
- Basic test componets and functionalits 
- Delete all comments in code with `tsconfig.js`(help performance)

## Scripts
There're some new scripts
- **dev** : Start the app
- **test** : Run Test
- **lint** : Check for errors according to eslintrc.json 

```json
    "dev": "react-scripts start",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.js --fix"
```

## Useful Resources

`App.tsx`

In the Form component, the prop as the theme is there because renders twice by default when you use `useContext` so one solution is pass a props or 
use things like `useCallback` || `useMemo` but I want to make it simple so I just pass it as a prop

```tsx
    <ContainerStyle animate={animationContainer} initial={animationInitial}>
        <AppContext.Provider value={{theme}}>
          <Header setTheme={setTheme}/>
          <Display display={display}/>
          <Form theme={theme} handleDisplay={handleDisplay}/>
        </AppContext.Provider>
      </ContainerStyle>
```

`FormLogic.tsx`

So the application logic is to update the object calculator, this depends on what that user clicks first, and if number, operation, and number2 have a value, and the user call =  do an operation depending on what value has the operation and update the display 
```tsx
 interface Icalcu {
    prev:string,
    next:string,
    operation:string,
    display:string
 }

const [calculator, setCalculator] = useState<Icalcu>({
    display:'',
    number:'',
    number2:'',
    operation:'',
  });

```

the special is use when the user want to make a multiply operation like a + b - c so in this case the `calculator.number` = a + b, the `calculator.operation` is - and `calculator.number2` = c  

So every time the user click a button call and depends what the user click call another functions and pass as parement the data-set of that button

```tsx
    const handleInput = (e:MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    const button = (e.target as HTMLButtonElement);
    const {number , operation, action} = button.dataset;
    
    if (number) {
      handleNumber(number);
      return;
    }

    if (operation) {
      handleOperation(operation);
      return;
    }

    if (action) {
      handleAction(action);
      return;
    }

  };
